The goal of this project is to make an object-oriented approach to making a state estimation algorithim

# SUMMARY OF CLASSES
##TEST CLASSES
these are classes that were created to assist in creating a functional test environment for making flight ready code

### main
### PALDataSample
### state_estimator
###

## FLIGHT CLASSES
these classes contain code and algorithms that could be used in flight.
### accel_integration
